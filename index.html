### What to Do If You Don't Get an Offer After Your Tech Internship

When I didn't get a full-time return offer, I found there was very little online to help me and it made me feel even worse than I already did. I survived it and lived to tell the tale. If you would like to see other inspiring tales of overcoming rejection in the technology industry, look at Rejected.us. My personal advice is below. 

Elle Woods (from Legally Blonde) is now your spirit animal. For a possible spoiler, Elle Woods was dumped for being too dumb to be a politician's wife. She overcame, fought her way to Harvard Law School to join the aspiring-senator who dumped her, and ended up becoming more successful in Law than he did. :zap: :sunny: :cyclone:

I may or may not have played the musical's album on repeat while I studied and practiced. Love is a strong driving force, and even if you're only driven by your love of a good mattress instead of a cardboard box, that should be enough. Now, what should you practice? I used Cracking the Coding Interview and ACM problems. Do them until your eyes bleed! I recommend ACM problems specifically because you can do them in whatever IDE you are comfortable with, they're slightly harder most of the time than questions you get, and some interviews will want to see actual working code. I think getting working code quickly is harder than writing code on a whiteboard. The interviewer will have to imagine this is how you are if they come to you one day to help fix a problem. Basically, show you're useful, and you know you are because you had a tech internship! If you did not have an internship and are reading this anyway, all I can say is good luck. :) 

What really happened?
Find out what you did wrong. This could be multiple things. Most likely, you were lacking in some Leadership Principles. I'm speaking in Amazon jargon, but the Leadership Principles are key to being a good developer besides coding skills. Earn your own trust in yourself and dive deep on any and all feedback you received. 

For more on this, it might help to do the 5 Whys. That might look something like this.

- Why did you not get a return offer?
- I didn't finish my goals for the midpoint evaluation and for the final evaluation.
- Why did you not finish your goals?
- I simultaneously asked for help too early and too late.
- Why did you ask for help too early in some cases?
- I did not have confidence in my methodology of solving problems. I thought my experience beforehand was not "real" coding, so why would it be useful now?
- Why did you ask for help too late in some cases?
- I did not have confidence in myself that a normal developer would have the same question I had, so I kept wasting time by reading more and debugging more. I also heard in a talk "How to Succeed in Your Internship" not to bother people who are high up because their time is valuable. This is a bunch of balogne and I wish so badly I never went to that talk. I could do a whole blog post on this, so I won't go into that here.
- Why did you have no confidence in yourself?
- Because I thought I was only there because of the diversity program. (root cause) <-- _prevent the root cause in the future_

(continued) another possible set of 5 Whys.
- Why did you not finish your goals? 
- I had a Product Manager (PM) Intern on the project as well.
- Why did the inexperience of your PM matter to meeting your goals?
- I could not deal with ambiguity very well.
- Why could you not deal with ambiguity very well?
- I did not have confidence in myself.
- Why did you have no confidence in yourself?
- Because I thought I was only there because of the diversity program. (root cause) <-- _prevent the root cause in the future_

Relationships are always two-way
Now, the root cause might actually be that you worked at a horrible place.  Now that I've been in the game for a few years, I can tell some red flags a little easier about a place that will mean I will not succeed there.  Sometimes the definition of success is not your definition of success, and that's ok.

Now you have wonderful questions to ask your interviewers at other companies at the end of the interview when they ask if you have any questions. 

Do you tell your next prospective job?
You should not talk about not getting a return offer unless asked. Most likely they won't... and don't worry about the ethics of keeping that secret. You still did the internship and can be honest about what you accomplished there and what you learned from it. 

Usually recruiters will get this out of you by asking if you have any pending offers, so they know whether to expedite your interview process. I didn't know at the time that they weren't out to get me and that hiring a developer pays for itself many times over, to them, so if anything they want to be kind. 

My nervousness explaining some weird in-one-year-I-can-interview-again story to one recruiter probably did more harm than good. I also get recruiting emails from that company I flundered with a few months later, so in the end it didn't matter. Point is, you should prepare your answer ahead of time for questions like these. Companies like grown-ups. Your answer should be honest, rehearsed, concise, and possibly what sets you apart. 

### What I Learned From Programmer Parents
#### June 15, 2016

Some people wonder where I got this idea to become a computer programmer.  Well, my parents both were.  Here's some lessons from them that I would like to share to spread the wisdom.  My mom passed away in February 2016 after I wrote this post initially, so I'll try not to modify her section unless I'm editing for clarity or adding memories to it.

**MOM**
- "It's like riding a bike" after I told her I was worried I wouldn't remember how to code after a 3 month vacation between graduation from my B.S. and starting my first job. It was, indeed, like riding a bike... in so many more ways than one and that's an idea for a blog post later ;)
- If my mom was stuck on something and didn't have someone around to help, she bought a book on it. She sometimes bought 5+ books per subject matter or problem. When she wanted to change her career path and become a statistician? Statistics for Dummies and countless others covered the dining table, opened and referenced constantly. When she wanted to start her own bed&breakfast aside from work? Books on that too. We had books on every language she ever wanted to learn. These days, books are not the best with the most up-to-date technologies these days, but she spared no expense when it came to education.
- Along with books, my mom was known by some as the one who printed out code. This taught me to print out code too if you need to, along the same lines of reasoning as buying "For Dummies" books.
- "They always went home at 5 where as I would stay at the office late all the time. They were so jealous that I would stay late because it would make them look bad." explaining to me that it's ok to stay late and work very hard because she, too worked late into the evenings in her first jobs. Better and better job offers kept coming as soon as she built up that reputation for good work.
- "Do not be a programmer." after she cut her hand while putting away dishes because she was distracted thinking about her program and had to drive herself to the hospital bleeding the whole way. She had previously mentioned to me that her coworkers said they would never let their children become programmers because of the strict deadlines and the immense pressure. She thought that was overboard to discourage your children from the same path, but I think the warning was valuable nontheless. Don't feel so pressured, that you break. It can exhibit itself in something physical like the freak dishes accident if you aren't careful.
- "Pick home or work, not both. You will have to do it alone because men say they will take care of you, but that is a lie. You will need to take care of them." when I was astounded when she mentioned that she hated feminism. I took one Feminist Political Theory class in college and started out thinking feminism was for women who didn't shave their armpits and finished it knowing I was feminist all along. I think my mom was just trying to say that programming sometimes advertises itself as the perfect career for working moms because you can work from home and have flexible hours, but in her experience she learned what Sheryl Sandberg wrote about later, that your partner needs to be a real partner for this to work, and it might be an empty promise you have to look out for.
- My mom brought her engineering problems to the dinner table at restaurants sometimes. To my embarrassment, she used the paper napkins to scribble tables and numbers, making us look like a family of robots who communicate in an alien language! I later connected the dots that she was basically whiteboarding her problems with her most trusted colleagues who happened to be outside her work team. As long as it is within confidentiality rules for your company and your friends or family actually wants to help you without any tangible reward, it does not matter at all how you solve your work problems! Your own creativity doesn't know business hours from non business hours, dinner napkins from whiteboaords, or coworkers from rubber duckies!

**DAD**
- "Nice clothes don't make your program run!" You could replace "nice clothes" with all kinds of material things. The point is pretty clear on its own.
- "Go home after the boss leaves each day and arrive an hour before everyone else. This way, you can ask them a question and they're still wrapping their head around the fact that you've been working for an hour already." I'd say take this one with a grain of salt because I haven't seen mind games like this work on anyone so far.
- "Never, ever raise your voice. If you find your voice rising, it's too late. You've lost. Pack your bags." This is pretty true no matter what. I don't know if you need to pack your bags, because I've seen people survive and succeed even after they get too angry, but it's a good lesson keep control of yourself at all times.
- "In business, you never want to say the market will go a certain way. You say 'Given XYZ about ABC, this will increase our AXY by X%' so then if they come back and say your prediction was incorrect, you can point out that XYZ was not true about ABC, therefore your forecast was still correct." This is more what he learned in business school, but I found it useful when weighing different technologies to use, for example.
- "I don't ask twice" this is more of a life thing, but I found this useful in opportunities that come up. If someone wants you to join their startup and you are really passionate about it, don't turn it down thinking it will always be there, because it probably won't be and definitely won't be in the same state it was when you were originally asked to join.
- Grammar is very important. I don't have a specific quote, but my dad silently judges someone (and loudly judges his children) if he hears them say "Him and me are going to go to the store"... or even "Bob and me are going to the store". The english standard is very important to him and I should have learned from this that everyone has their own thing they personally fight for in their technology standards at work. For example, I was burned by not reading the style guidelines before submitting a code review in a new coding language. It is pretty awful to be linked the first result of a search for a coding language's style guidelines in a code review and it wasted a lot of time I could have saved if I only took my dad's advice and judged myself loudly for looking up the standard style in the language I was writing code in beforehand.

### What I Learned Volunteering for the GHC Scholarship Committee
#### February 19, 2017

I can't talk about the applications themselves, or what you should do to get a scholarship to go to Grace Hopper from the Anita Borg Institute itself, but I will talk about the lessons I learned volunteering on this committee. Full disclaimer: I did slightly more than the bare minimum of about 10 application reviews to consider myself a volunteer every year. I would do more, but I have a full time job and I wanted to really look at every single word submitted to consider every applicant. This celebration changes lives and I can only dream of what this would have brought to my career if I went to it as a student.
- The young women applying to this scholarship are amazing. I'm so appreciative of the opportunity to see a peek inside all of these professional lives even before they have even begun. The future is bright!
- Although the future is bright, right now it is dark for a lot of women applying to the scholarship. The feeling of isolation comes in different forms. The experience can be different not only around the world but even within the United States or within the same school. Since learning this, I have kept in mind that what might have appealed to me while I was a student might not appeal to other women so we all have to continually learn new things to fix the gender gap in tech.
- Not only is the experience different for the candidates, but the review itself is only fair because there are other reviewers besides me that review each application without seeing my review. My experience in the work force is only one experience among millions and it influenced my review more heavily than I expected. For example, given the same guidelines as other reviewers, I weighed GPA lightly because my GPA in college wasn't a 4.0, so I didn't think it was very immportant. Because someone pointed out the candidate's GPA in another review, the final decision took that into account. I will never know the final results of all the candidates I reviewed, but there was so much value in having reviews from various pairs of eyes with the same goal.
- Because I don't know the results of my reviews beyond how close I was to the other reviewers and didn't attend the party with all the scholarship grants, I didn't "see" my impact on any individual candidate. I found that volunteering for my company's booth on the career fair floor was much more personal. If you are looking for a connection, the scholarship review committee might not be the ideal committee to volunteer with. It was a great start for me.

### How to Get the Most Out of Grace Hopper Celebration
#### February 19, 2017

* Submit your resume to the resume database! I cannot stress this enough. You'll likely get a lot of emails, and this shouldn't bother you if you are already on linkedin and get a lot of emails anyway! Companies cannot invite you to anything if they don't know you exist or know that you are going to GHC.
* Bring snacks for your room. You need to eat breakfast and you probably will not have time to stand in line to get breakfast there. Starbucks will be very crowded, too, so do what you have to do for whatever caffeine keeps you going.
* Have some goals in mind. Just like purposeful coding is better for enhancing your skill than passively reading some APIs, purposeful networking and talk participation is key. I think quantifiable goals help, but don't be afraid to only have one goal at a time or even a whole goal for the entire conference. I had a much better time my second year because I went with the goal of finding out how my organization can recruit and keep more women. I therefore jumped "tracks" fewer times and came back with insights for my diversity programs team they didn't have otherwise (that I know of).
* If you aren't actively looking for a job/school or otherwise don't need to go to the career fair, save your career fair visiting for when a talk you wanted to go to gets filled up. They fill up sometimes and it can be intimidating to bother someone on their laptop in a hallway. As an aside, if you want to be bothered at a table, don't have your laptop out. On second thought, don't even bring your laptop to the celebration. Note taking is better on paper because it is less distracting. Remember to schedule time to type them up later.
